This webinar features R and parallelization in the context of Monte Carlo simulations.

## Abstract

[From sharcnet.ca](https://www.sharcnet.ca/help/index.php/Webinar_2016_Parallel_and_high_performance_computing_with_R)

In this seminar we will talk about the use of R in a parallel processing environment.
We will discuss the general issues concerning the performance of R code,
the intrinsic features of R and parallelization by looking at a few simple examples of Monte Carlo simulations.
The targeted audience are those who have had experience with R but not much with parallel processing.
