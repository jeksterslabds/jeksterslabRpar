Future: Simple Async, Parallel & Distributed Processing in R - What's Next?

Henrik Bengtsson's talk at the rstudio::conf 2020.

## Abstract

[From rstudio.com](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/future-simple-async-parallel-distributed-processing-in-r-what-s-next/)

Future is a minimal and unifying framework for asynchronous, parallel, and distributed computing in R.
It is designed for robustness, consistency, scalability, extendability, and adoptability -
all in the spirit of "developer writes code once, user runs it anywhere".
It is being used in production for high-performance computing and asynchronous UX,
among other things.
In this talk,
I will discuss common feature requests,
recent progress we have made, and what is the pipeline.
